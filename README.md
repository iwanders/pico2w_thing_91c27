# Pico2w_thingy_91c27

A work in progress repo for a prototype sensor board that attaches to a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W.

## What's with the name?
Naming is hard... This is a bit of a vague project to attempt... also:
```
$ head -c 100 /dev/urandom  | md5sum | head -c 5
91c27
```

## Building Picotool
It's a nice statically linked binary that seems better supported than [elf2uf2-rs](https://github.com/JoNil/elf2uf2-rs),
going to try to use the 'upstream' supported tools to flash the device.

- The usual build tools; `apt install build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake`, usually just `libusb-1.0-0-dev`.
- Clone `https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool`, checkout release tag (`2.1.1`).
- Clone `https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk`, checkout release tag (`2.1.1`).
- `cmake ../picotool/ -DPICO_SDK_PATH=../pico-sdk`
- `make picotool`
- `./picotool`, or move it elsewhere.

Don't forget to install the udev rules from the picotool udev directory to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`.

## Probe-rs
Upstream version complains about glibc versions, so compile from source with;
```
cargo install probe-rs-tools --locked
```
